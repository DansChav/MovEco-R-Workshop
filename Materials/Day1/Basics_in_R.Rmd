## Importing Data

Our first task is to read this data into our R environment.  To this, we will use the `read_csv` function. Reading in a data file is called *parsing*, which sounds much more sophisticated.  For good reason too -- parsing different data files and formats is a cornerstone of all pratical data science research, and can often be the hardest step.

## Importing Data

So what do we need to know about this file in order to read it into R?

```{r, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```


```{r, render=print}
## Let's try:
co2 <- read_table("ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt")
co2
```


## Importing Data

hmm... no luck.  Let's try defining the comment symbol:


```{r , render=print}
co2 <- read_tsv("ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt",
                comment = "#")
co2
```


## Importing Data

Getting there, but not quite done. Our first row is being interpreted as column names.  The documentation also notes that certain values are used to indicate missing data, which we would be better off converting to explicitly missing so we don't get confused.


```{r}
co2 <- read.table("ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt",
                  sep = "", comment = "#",
                  col.names = c("year", "month", "decimal_date", 
                                "average", "interpolated", 
                                "trend", "days"),
                  na.strings = c("-1", "-99.99"))
co2 %>% head()
```


## Importing Data

Alternately, with `readr::read_table` from `tidyverse` 

```{r eval=FALSE}
#devtools::install_github("tidyverse/readr")
co2 <- read_table("ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt", 
                  comment = "#",
                  col_names = c("year", "month", "decimal_date", 
                                "average", "interpolated", "trend", "days"),
                  col_types = c("iiddddi"),
                  na = c("-1", "-99.99"))
```

No luck, see: <https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/pull/563>

## Importing Data

 Seems that `comment` arg is not fully implemented in CRAN version of `readr` so we must rely on `skip` to avoid the comment block:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
co2 <- read_table("ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt",
                  col_names = c("year", "month", "decimal_date", 
                                "average", "interpolated", "trend", "days"),
                  col_types = c("iiddddi"),
                  na = c("-1", "-99.99"),
                  skip = 72)
co2 
```

Success! We have read in the data. Now we're ready to rock and roll.

## Plotting Data with `ggplot`

Effective visualizations are an integral part of data science, poorly organized or poorly labelled figures can be as much a source of peril as understanding.  Nevertheless, the ability to generate plots quickly with minimal tinkering is an essential skill.  As standards for visualizations have increased, too often visualization is seen as an ends rather than a means of data analysis. See [Fox & Hendler (2011)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/705.short) for more discussion of this.

## Plotting Data with `ggplot`


```{r}
ggplot(co2, aes(decimal_date, average)) + geom_line()
```


## Plotting multiple series

We often would like to plot several data values together for comparison,
for example the average, interpolated and trend co2 data. We can do
this in three steps:

1) subsetting the dataset to the columns desired for plotting

```{r}
co2_sub <- co2 %>%
    select(decimal_date, average, interpolated, trend)
co2_sub %>% head()
```


## Plotting multiple series

2) rearranging the data into a "long" data table where the data values
are stacked together in one column and there is a separate column that
keeps track of the whether the data came from the average,
interpolated, or trend column. Notice by using the same name,
we overwrite the original co2_sub


```{r}
co2_sub <- co2_sub %>%
    gather(series, ppmv, -decimal_date)
co2_sub %>% head()
```
