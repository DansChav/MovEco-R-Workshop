# Movement data
As mentioned this morning, movement data may come in a variety of forms and resolutions, 
and the analyses 


Here we are going to introduce working with movement data as `ltraj` objects in the 
adehabitat library which makes extracting simple path metrics like tortuosity, 
and persistence, simple. 

# Ltraj objects
```{r}
library(adehabitatLT)
data("whale")
data("albatross")
data("hseal")

```

## Side note: Regular vs. Irreguar Trajectories

# Path Metrics 
## Step Length
## Turning Angle (Relative v. Absolute)
## Tortuosity, Straightness Index
## Persistence, Persistence Velocity
## Displacement, Net Squared Displacement
