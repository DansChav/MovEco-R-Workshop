# Unit IV: Spatial Data Module

## { .cover }

<img src="images/cover.png" class="cover">

## Goals of this Module
- Introduce the `sf` package
- Demostrate use of `dplyr` data management functions on spatial data
- Manipulate raster and vector data
- Introduce concepts of spatial geometry and projections


## The sf package

The **sf** ("simple features") package is an R implementation of:  
 - a new spatial data class system in R  
 - functions for reading and writing spatial data  
 - tools for spatial operations on vectors  

## Vector Data

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
A representation of the world using points, lines, and
polygons. Vector models are useful for storing data that has discrete boundaries,
such as country borders, land parcels, and streets.

Often, stored as "shapefiles", .shp

## Raster Data

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
<img src="images/raster_concept.png" width = "420">
</p><p class="double-flow">
A representation of the world as a surface divided 
into a regular grid of cells. Raster models are useful for storing data that 
varies continuously, as in an aerial photograph, a satellite image, 
a surface of chemical concentrations, or an elevation surface.

Often, stored as "GeoTIFFs", .tif
