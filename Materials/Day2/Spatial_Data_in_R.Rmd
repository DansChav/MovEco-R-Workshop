- Projections, transformations
- visualizing spatial data (mapview, ggplot +geom_sf)

# Introduction
Today we are going to get our first taste of working with movement data in R, but we will begin by
introducing you to spatial data analysis in R more generally. In this section we will
review some of the R packages available for handling spatial data, discuss the
format of different spatial data types, and explore how we can manipulate and visualize these
in R. 

Much of the content and structure of this tutorial was inspired by Jamie Afflerbach's own introduction 
to the `sf` library and spatial analysis in R (see her 
[spatial-analysis-R repo](https://github.com/jafflerbach/spatial-analysis-R)). I 
have adapted it here for the specific purposes of our workshop.

## Packages

Primarily we will be introducing the  **sf** ("simple features") package for working 
with simple spatial data. 

The **sf** library is an R implementation of:  
 - a new spatial data class system in R  
 - functions for reading and writing spatial data  
 - tools for spatial operations on vectors  
 
Ultimately this seeks to replace the older **sp**, **rgdal**, **rgeos** packages 
which formed the original toolset for working with spatial data in R. The **sf** library
replaces the S4 class structure used in **sp** with simple feature access - the current standard
across industry for organizing spatial data -- extending R's data.frame structure directly
to accept spatial geometry attributes and making it easier to manipulate spatial datasets
using tools like dplyr and the tidyverse. However, as this package is new and under 
developement there are times were we will switch back to the S4 class structure to play
nice with our movement packages. 

More information regarding this shift [here](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2017/01/03/simple-features-now-on-cran)

Spatial data comes in two forms:

1. Vector data
2. Raster data

With important differences across classes. 

## Vector Data
Vector models are a representation of the world using points, lines, and
polygons. This class is useful for storing data that has discrete boundaries,
such as country borders, land parcels, and streets.

Often, vector data is stored as "shapefiles" (.shp)

## Raster Data
Raster models are a representation of the world as a surface divided 
into a regular grid of cells. These are useful for storing data that 
varies continuously, as in an aerial photograph, a satellite image, 
a surface of chemical concentrations, or an elevation surface.

Often, Rasters are stored as "GeoTIFFs" (.tif)

The **sf** library is used to store vector data but when working with raster data
we will use operations from packages **raster** and **velox**. 

Later when we work with movement data we may find a need for other spatial packages in R
such as: **spatial**, the **adehabitat** packages, **maptools**, **mapview**, 
and the developers version of **ggplot2**. 

# Activities

To begin today, we are going to demonstrate how to **sf** and **tidyverse** libraries
together to manipulate spatial *vector* data. 

## Step 1. Set up our environment and read in the data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#install.packages(c("sf", "mapview"))
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(mapview)
```

**sf** objects usually have two classes - `sf` and `data.frame`.
Two main differences comparing to a regular `data.frame` object are 
spatial metadata (`geometry type`, `dimension`, `bbox`, `epsg (SRID)`, 
`proj4string`) and additional column - typically named `geom` or `geometry`.

Today we are going to play with a shapfile of Hong Kong's geographic boundaries
downloaded from the [global administrative areas database](http://www.gadm.org/download)
and provided for you in the `shapefiles` directory. 

First we need to unzip the downloaded file:
```{r}
unzip("./shapefiles/HKG_Adm_gdb.zip", exdir="shapefiles")
```

Now let's use the `st_read` function to read this in. Within the `sf` library
most commands begin with the "st" prefix. Since our file is a geodatabase we need 
to first investigate which layers it contains. To do that we use the `st_layers`
command. 

```{r}
st_layers(dsn = "shapefiles/HKG_adm.gdb")  # check layers
# looks like layer 1 is just the complerte boundary - note that it has 1 feature
# and layer 2 might be multiple regions within the province?

HK_boundary <- st_read(dsn = "shapefiles/HKG_adm.gdb", layer="HKG_adm0") # read in
HK_regions <- st_read(dsn = "shapefiles/HKG_adm.gdb", layer="HKG_adm1")  # one at a time

```

### sf, data.frame Attributes

Just for kicks, prove to yourself that a sf object is just a fancy data.frame:
check out the class structure of "sf" objects
```{r}
class(HK_boundary)
```

Because of their dual class structure: **sf** objects can be used as a regular 
`data.frame` object in many operations. For instance, we can call simple data.frame
operations like `nrow` or `names` on these objects with ease

```{r}
nrow(HK_regions)
ncol(HK_regions)
names(HK_regions)
```

If we are ever curious about just the dataframe or just the geometry separately, 
we can use `st_geometry` commands.  By setting the geometry to 'NULL' using `st_set_geometry`, a `sf`
object returns to a simple data.frame. Calling the `st_geometry` from an sf object 
would extract just the spatial attributes turning this into a "simple feature collection" or "sfc". 

```{r}
HK_boundary %>% class # complete sf object

HK_boundary %>% st_set_geometry(NULL) %>% class  # force to data.frame

HK_boundary %>% st_geometry() %>% class  # extract only the spatial info, force to "sfc"
```

# Step 2: Visualize
Let's take a look at our shapefiles, make sure they look like we expect. 
```{r}
# look what happens when we use generic plot on the whole dataframe
HK_regions %>% plot

# pull just the geometry
HK_boundary %>% st_geometry() %>% plot
HK_regions %>% st_geometry() %>% plot

# or pull just one column
plot(HK_regions["NAME_1"])
```


## sf & dplyr

It also easy to use the **dplyr** package on `sf` objects:

`select()`

```{r select}

west_shp_sf %>%
  select(rgn, rgn_key, geometry)

```

`filter()`

```{r filter}

west_shp_sf %>%
  filter(rgn == "Oregon")

```

`mutate()`

```{r mutate}

sf_out <- west_shp_sf %>%
  mutate(rgn_id = c(1:5),
         area_km2 = area_m2/1000000) #converting square meters to square kilometers

sf_out
```

# Union

You can merge all polygons into one using `st_union()`.
```{r st_union}

full_rgn  <- st_union(sf_out)

plot(full_rgn)

#try plotting with ggplot2

 # ggplot(full_rgn) +
 #   geom_sf()
```

This doesn't work because now the object is a single geometry object of class `sfc` which is not a data.frame that ggplot requires for plotting. To turn an `sfc` object back into an `sf` object use `st_sf()`.

```{r st_sf}

full_rgn <- st_union(sf_out) %>%
            st_sf(geometry = .)

 ggplot(full_rgn) +
   geom_sf()
```



# Projections

![]("./../../images/crs.png")


```{r}
library(raster)
npp <- raster( "rasters/annual_npp.tif")
plot(npp)
crs(npp)

plot(projectRaster(npp, crs = "+proj=lcc +lat_1=48 +lat_2=33 +lon_0=-100 +ellps=WGS84"))


```

# Mapview

```{r}
#mapview(west_shp_sf)

st_sample(west_shp_sf, 25) -> fish

#icon: http://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/
fishIcon <- makeIcon("images/lumpsucker.jpg", 18,18)

leaflet(fish) %>% addTiles %>% addMarkers(icon=fishIcon)

#mapview(west_shp_sf)@map %>% addTiles %>%  addMarkers(data = fish, icon=fishIcon)

#%>% addFeatures(data = fish, icon = fishIcon)

```


# Visualize with ggplot

`ggplot2` now has integrated functionality to plot sf objects using `geom_sf()`.

```{r}

#simplest plot
ggplot(HK) +
  geom_sf()

```

This is useful to make sure your file looks correct but doesn't display any information about the data. We can plot these regions and fill each polygon based on the rgn_id.

```{r}
ggplot(HK_regions) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = NAME_1))
```
